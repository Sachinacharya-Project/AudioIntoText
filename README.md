# AUDIO2TEXT
________________________________________________________________________________________________
This particular piece of code can convert AudioFile(wave file) into Text.
Since, this is using AI(Google Recognition), it might predict text from audio off the track other than that
it is very reliable.
It has one more Drawback
It only Reads WAVE file i.e. AudioName.wav type file and
It converts mp3-format audio into wav-format audio if provided audio is mp3 otherwise it cannot convert
other file-type. And Converision process is not yet reliable.
## Requirements:
````python
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pydub
"""
For Unix
pip == pip3
"""
````
## USAGE
````python
python "audio to text.py"
Enter AudioFile Name: your_audio_name
"""
For Unix
python == python3
"""
DONE! DONE! DONE!
